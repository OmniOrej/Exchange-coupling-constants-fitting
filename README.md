The goal of this exercise is to calculate the exchange coupling constants (J values) for a Fe3 complex. This system contains three magnetic centers, each with a spin of 5/2.

The files shown correspond to the log outputs generated by Gaussian (Energies in Hartree). Molecule 1 represents the ferromagnetic configuration, whereas Molecules 2, 3, and 4 correspond to configurations where a single spin flip is applied to the first, second, and third magnetic centers (Fe atoms), respectively.

The jpg figure shows the calculated values of J in cm-1.

Additionaly, the presentation video is included.
